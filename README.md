#### _Web APIs: Timed Quiz, 10.10.20_

### _By Lohelani Hicks_

## Description and Method

For this project I used javascript to create a timed quiz. Included css styling, javascript and bootstrap(and consequently the appropriate links). Utilized a javascript page for the quiz page, and another for the highscores page. In this project I demonstrated proper use of functions, variables, for loops, and if/else statements throughout the javascript pages to accomplish the requirements of the quiz.

## Requirements
Once the user starts the quiz, present the first question and start the coutdown timer.
When the user selects an answer, pause the quiz timer and let the user know if the answer right/wrong.
If the user is wrong, subtract penalty time from the clock.
After 2 seconds, proceed to the next question and resume the countdown timer.
If the countdown timer reaches 0 the quiz is over.
If the user answers all the questions the quiz is over.
The user's score and initials are then saved after which the high scores will be displayed.
Also provide a link straight to viewing the high scores page.
Included links to bootstraps css, and bootstrap javasript in the code.
